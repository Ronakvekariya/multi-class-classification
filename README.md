# Objective :
- To learn to predict from multiple class

# Dataset: IRIS
- Just accustome your self with multi-class classification problem , one can work with very basic dataset such as IRIS.

# Model : LogisticRegression
- With Parametere set to handle multi-class
- multi_class = 'multinomial' , solver = 'lbfgs'

# Result:
- With such a small and easy to do with problem , this model is providing 100% score in classifying.
- But as the complexity of the data and relationship between features and features and target increase , the other varient are more likely to suited for such problem.
